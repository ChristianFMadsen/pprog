The number of steps does not change between the method with a numerical Jacobian and the method with an analytic Jacobian.
The amount of function calls is reduced when using an analytic Jacobian.
The GSL root finder takes significantly less steps when solving the Rosenbrock function compared to my routine. My routine takes 393 steps while the GSL routine takes 5 steps.
