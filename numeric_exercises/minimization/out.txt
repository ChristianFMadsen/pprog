Part A: Newton's minimization method with explicit derivatives:
Finding the minimum of the Rosenbrock valley function: 
Start vector x:
3
5
Minimum found at:
1
1
At found minimum: f(x)=1.19973e-13
In 19 steps.
Finding the minimum of the Himmelblau function:
Start vector x:
-1
7
Minimum found at:
3
2
At found minimum: f(x)=1.96748e-17
In 8 steps.


Part B: Quasi-Newton method with Broyden's update:
Finding the minimum of the Rosenbrock valley function: 
Start vector x:
3
5
Minimum found at:
0.996959
0.993903
At found minimum: f(x)=9.30638e-06
In 30 steps.
Finding the minimum of the Himmelblau function:
Start vector x:
-1
7
Minimum found at:
-3.77932
-3.28319
At found minimum: f(x)=3.53823e-09
In 11 steps.
Note that the method from part A) takes less steps than the quasi Newton method.
Compared to the root finding exercise where the Newton's method with numerical Jacobian was used:
Rosenbrock: 393 steps taken, Himmelblau: 8 steps taken
